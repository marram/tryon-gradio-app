### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fashn-AI/tryon-gradio-app
cd tryon-gradio-app
```

2. Install the required packages using uv:

```

If you don't have uv installed, you can install it with:

### Usage

1. Set the environment variable `FASHN_API_KEY` to the API key you created on the FASHN platform.
```bash

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:7860/` to see the app in action.

If you wish to deploy the app or share it with others, you can use the `share` function in Gradio to generate a public link.
More on this can be found in the [Gradio documentation](https://gradio.app/docs).
